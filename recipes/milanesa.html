    <h3>A Real Argentinian Milanesa.</h3>
    <p>Similar to the Austrian wiener schnitzel, the Italian 
        cotoletta alla Milanese, and the Japanese tonkatsu, 
        the Argentinian milanesa is also a breaded cutlet 
        shallow-fried in oil. The cutlet typically comes either 
        from the round or from the eye of the round, which are 
        lean cuts, meaning they have less fat, marbling, and 
        sinew when compared to most other cuts of beef. 
        Besides beef, milanesa can also be prepared with veal,
        pork, or be made vegetarian by using soy cutlets or 
        eggplant instead.</p>
