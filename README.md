# odin-recipes
We will be doing the basic HTML project from The Odin Project Web Fundamentals course.
Will be trying to make the structure of an index page, and some others pages containing food recipes that i like.
The main goal of this is to learn how to make a basic HTML structure.

The HTML of the page is finished. Loved to make this, the moment i started writing the html code i couldn't stop. Looking forward to the CSS styling of this one and maybe adding scripts through Javascript.
